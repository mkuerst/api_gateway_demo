# API Gateway Demo
What you will learn:

* What is an API gateway. Why is it required and what are its tasks.
* Connect the frontend of a simple ToDo app with a backend by exposing the API using Gravitee, an open-source API management platform that provides tools to secure, publish, manage, and monitor APIs.
* What are plans and flows and how to add them to the API gateway using yaml files or through the Gravitee UI.
* Future: Adding AM (Access Management) to the API gateway.
